It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say</p>
<img src="cording.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:45px;">I wanna dance
The music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah
Let's break our plans
And live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance</p>
